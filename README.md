# ios-shortcuts
Repository of my shortcuts for storage.  They are in a apple's format and exported through the shortcuts apps.

# iSober
iSober written as Siri Shortcuts

# Huffduffer
This allows me to upload MP3 files to dropbox and then "Share" them into Huffduffer so I can get them via postcast.
After my app (Overcast) caches them, I can delete the files from Dropbox.  Great way to read ebooks.
